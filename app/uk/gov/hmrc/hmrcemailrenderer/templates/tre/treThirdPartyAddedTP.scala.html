        Dear customer
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.315789474;">
        A business has given you third-party access on our service. This means you can request and download CDS reports on their behalf.
    </p>

    <h2>How to access CDS data</h2>

    <ol>
        <li style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.315789474;">Go to GOV.UK.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.315789474;">Search for 'Get customs declaration data for imports and exports'.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.315789474;">Log in to your account. If you’re not subscribed to the CDS service, the ‘Request a report’ section on the guidance page shows the steps to set this up.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.315789474;">Select ‘Businesses you have third-party access to’ in the view data access section of your dashboard to check the details of your access.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Why you are receiving this email</h2>

        A business gave us your EORI number when setting up third-party access to their CDS data.
