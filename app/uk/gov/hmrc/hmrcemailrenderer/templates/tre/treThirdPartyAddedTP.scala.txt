Dear customer

A business has given you third-party access on our service. This means you can request and download CDS reports on their behalf.

How to access CDS data

1. Go to GOV.UK.

2. Search for 'Get customs declaration data for imports and exports'.

3. Log in to your account. If you’re not subscribed to the CDS service, the ‘Request a report’ section on the guidance page shows the steps to set this up.

4. Select ‘Businesses you have third-party access to’ in the view data access section of your dashboard to check the details of your access.

Why you are receiving this email

A business gave us your EORI number when setting up third-party access to their CDS data.
